RESTful web services with Drupal 7 (an introduction)

based on a presentation at DBUG on 2012-May-09

How to play with the sample modules:

- in consume_api/consume_api.module

  - set API_PROVIDER_URL to the URL of your own provider

  - set CONSUME_API_USER and CONSUME_API_PASS to the login details of your special API-provider user
